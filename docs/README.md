# vue-play

> UI Component Dev Environment for Vue

With vue-play, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively. Just like react-storybook for React.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g vue-play-cli
```

Then it's done! To create a `play.js` \(I call it "play script"\) in your project folder and start playing!
