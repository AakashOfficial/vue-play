# vue-play

> UI Component Dev Environment for Vue

With vue-play, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively. Just like react-storybook for React.

## Installation

Install the command-line tool with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
# npm install -g vue-play-cli
yarn global add vue-play-cli
```

Install `vue-play` package in your project:

```bash
# npm install -D vue-play
~/my-project yarn add vue-play --dev
```

Then it's almost done! To create a `play.js` \(I call it "play script"\) in your project folder and start playing!
